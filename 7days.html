<p>Maybe you'd like it
What's the harm in trying anyway?

See I'd lace you up with my poetry
A sad day a happy poem
A happy day a kiss in the lips
I mean, I'd kiss you with each vibe from my pen
I'd psyche you up with perfect rhymes and cold days</p>

<p>Wueeeh, I'd brew you late night coffee as i sit by the bedside to type
I mean, to type and tell the world how hot than my coffee you are
You love breakfast in bed,right?
So what about a handwritten poem next to you each wake

Let's date
You might like how much I'll intertwine you in my words or just imagine a stream of romantic poems with you as the persona
You don't have to worry about the end of the poem
I'll have a TBC section in each one of them</p>

<p>I mean, I might even write a book about you
Don't you want to tell the world how good it feels to be the lines
The poet Vibes or entirely the whole masterpiece?

Let's date huh!
Maybe you'd like it

What's the harm in trying anyway???

            <h2><u>FROM THE DAY I SAW YOU</u></h2>
         <img src="from.jpg" width="200">   
From the day I saw you,
My heart began to race,
My senses were awakened,
And my soul began to chase.

With just a single glance,
You captured my attention,
Your beauty, your grace,
Left me in admiration.
<br>
From the day I saw you,
My world began to spin,
I couldn't believe my eyes,
And didn't know where to begin.

Your smile was like sunshine,
Brightening up my day,
Every step you took,
Took my breath away.
<br>
From the day I saw you,
I knew I was never the same,
For your love had captivated me,
And you were the only one to blame.

Now, I sit here and marvel,
At the journey we've been through,
All thanks to that moment,
From the day I saw you.

<h2>PLEASE SAY YES I DO</h2>
  <img src="yes.jpg" width="200">  
<p>Please say yes I do,
And let our love always be true.
Together we'll walk this path of life,
And make beautiful memories all through.</p>

<p> please say yes I do,
And let your heart guide you to
A love so deep and a love so true,
That no hurdle can break us into two.</p>

<p>Please say yes I do,
And let our bond be strong like glue.
We'll laugh and dance and sing with glee,
And cherish each moment so lovingly.</p>
<p>
Please say yes I do,
And let us build a life anew,
Full of light and love so bright,
That our future never dims from our sight.</p>
<p>
Please say yes I do,
And make all my dreams come true.
We'll create a love story so grand,
That it will be remembered forever in this land.</p>
<p>
Please say yes I do,
And let our destiny be a rendezvous.
Through thick and thin, we'll always be,
Together, forever, just you and me.
Please say yes I do.</p>

<h2>HER LAUNDRY</h2>
  <img src="her.jpg" width="200">  
I fold her clothes with gentle care,
Sorting them with loving stare.
I want to make her life easier,
My girlfriend whom I treasure.

Her laundry basket seems so heavy,
But I’ll carry it with ease gladly.
I’ll make her favorite shirt clean,
And her jeans as good as seen.
<br>
I’ll scrub her stains with patience,
And rinse them with diligence.
I’ll press them flat for neatness,
All for her satisfaction and happiness.

I’ll be her laundry helper,
Her struggles, I will not defer.
With me by her side always,
Let her laundry worries be washed away.

As clothes are hung and dried with care,
Our teamwork proves that love is there.
Through every task, big or small,
Our bond grows stronger, climbing with each haul.<br>

The scent of fresh laundry fills the air,
And we bask in the comfort of knowing we're there.
True love is shown in the smallest ways,
And with this teamwork, our love forever stays.

<h1> SOMEONE LIKE ME</h1>
  <img src="like.jpg" width="200">  
<p>i'm not looking for the perfect girl
perfect lips, perfect hips
these long shapely legs
lips that pout
i'm looking for a sparkle
in her eyes
communication
someone to laugh with
beauty, is how I see her
</p>
<p>it doesn't matter
how she looks
a broken tooth
a scar
we've all got scars
it's her smile
communication
someone to laugh with

I don't want a barbie
false boobs
false lips
I want her to be as she is
just as she is
with all her faults
and all the imperfections

someone like me</p>

<h1>I MISS HER</h1>
  <img src="miss.jpg" width="200">  
<p>She had every intention to stay, 
I'm the one that pushed her away, 
Not heeding to a word she had to say, 
I should have listened, wasn't that hard anyway, 
I left her, now she's left me too, she's gone far away.
</p>
I thought i was strong, 
I didn't need her, i was better off on my own, 
The pain would ease away not after long, 
The wounds would heal and the feelings would wane before long, 
I had never been so wrong!

I do miss her, though hard to admit, 
I miss the sound of her soft heartbeat, 
With her breasts pressed against my chest, 
I see her in my dreams when i go to sleep at night, 
Even when i open my eyes at first light.
<p>
I recall the memories we made, the dark secrets, 
Our wicked dance between the sheets, 
The wild orgasms and squirts, 
The soft moans that would then escape her lips, 
Trust me every shred of it hurts.

So when you see her, tell her, i dont live life anymore, 
Tell her, my heart does not beat like before, 
Tell her,  I'm not the same anymore, 
Tell her,  i need her like never before, 
And the thought of losing her hurts me more.

 <h1> 7DAYS 7POEMS</h1>
 <img src="7.jpg" width="200">
<p>Seven days, seven poems,
A challenge to write and create,
To express ourselves in verse,
And let our hearts resonate.
</p>
With each passing day,
Our words flowed and took flight,
A journey of introspection,
A path to find our light.

Some days were easy,
The words flowed like a stream,
Other days were a struggle,
A writer's worst nightmare, it seemed.
<p>
But each day we persevered,
With pen in hand and heart on sleeve,
We poured our souls into the ink,
And found solace in what we believed.

Now the challenge is complete,
Seven days, seven poems we wrote,
But the journey continues,
For the muse lives on, we hope.
</p>
<p> So let us keep writing,
Let our words continue to flow,
For in poetry we find ourselves,
And let our hearts and minds grow.

Seven days, seven poems,
A challenge that we embraced,
And in the end, we found,
A love for poetry that cannot be replaced.

</p>
